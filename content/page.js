I've been working full time since graduating from The George Washington University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science and have also been pursuing a part-time Masters degree in Artificial Intelligence at The Johns Hopkins University and am set to graduate in Spring of 2025.\n\nAI was also my undergraduate focus and I am passionate about exploring AI and its capabilites as they relate to sustainabilty and health particulalry.\n\nWhen not working, I'm also very active in local recreational sports, playing volleyball, dodgeball, and kickball. I've recently revisited my hobby of wheelthrowing as well, and am looking forward to summer when I can pick kayaking back up on the Delaware River."
